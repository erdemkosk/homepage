# What is it ?

> Each daily Streamle features a photo clip from a popular TV Show or Movie published on a popular streaming platform. Guess in as few tries as possible, and be sure to come back every day for a new Movie/Series.

Streamle helps you find content to watch on your favorite streaming platform with a triva-like interface inspired by Wordle & Heardle and all ...dle family. Each daily Streamle features a photo clip from a popular TV Show or Movie published on the streaming platform. Guess in as few tries as possible, and be sure to come back every day for a new Movie/Series. Learn more about the content by watching the trailer and reading the content card. Go to the streaming service to watch right now :)

I started building Streamle a couple of weeks ago when I saw the news about the acquisition of Heardle by Spotify. The acquisition can be seen as an attempt to improve music discovery and keep listeners on the Spotify app. Then I said why not the streaming services like Netflix and Streamle has started.

I am trying to follow lean product practices. I've deployed it to the Web and started to get feedback from close friends and developed further. Since Flutter is used on frontend it is ready to publish on app stores and I will soon. NodeJs is used backend and heroku for deployment.

Features on Roadmap:

- Stats
- Leaderboard
- Multiple Content (Discoverable by genres)
- Save Content to watch later
- Share footage with friends to help to guess
- Compete with a friend

I hope you like it and let me know what you think about Streamle. Feel free to share your ideas to add to my roadmap.
Thanks.
